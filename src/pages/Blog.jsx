            Not exactly sure how a blog is built, but my guess is to have a folder that the page puts files into, reads the file's header, subheader, and part of the body, and pulls the files when the user want to read more of the blog.

            What is Needed:
            - A folder to store the blogs
            - Script to scrap info from the folder
                - Display the info
            - Area to click to read the blog


            - Areas to write the blog

            */}

        </div>
    )
}

export default Blog
